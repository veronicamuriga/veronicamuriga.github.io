### Twivia

I participated in Twitter's first virtual invite-only hackathon, after  attending one of Twitter University's spring camps, #DevelopHer '20. I was put in a team with five other enthusiastic and creative students from both North  and South American colleges, and in two days we built [Twivia](bit.ly/twiviadevpost), a Twitter trivia game. Twivia ranked 3rd overall out of 9 teams.

I implemented the backend in Python running in a Flask server, interfacing with Twitter's API using tweepy and communicating with the frontend through Heroku. The backend consisted of two games- #WhoSaidThat which presented a user with a tweet and prompted them to guess who posted it, and #WhoHasMoreFollowers, where the user selected which account had more followers given two choices.

### Interactive Fishing Game Team Project

For my freshman spring IOT class final project, my team designed a smart fishing game consisting of a fishing rod, on which was mounted an ESP-32 along with components such as a digital compass for motion sensing, a rotary encoder for a reel, IMU, speaker and buzzer. The user orients themselves towards any given heading and swings the fishing rod. If the line falls within the vicinity of a fish, the user has caught that fish and their points are incremented in a database hosted in a remote server. To communicate with the server, the game was supported by server-side scripts written in Python.

I thoroughly enjoyed the material of the class. Iâ€™ve always been really interested in physics and combining it with code to making a product from scratch was amazing. I learnt to navigate team dynamics- how to balance out making people work on things they were already comfortable with doing, with working on something out of one's comfort zone.

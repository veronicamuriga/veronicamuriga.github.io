I was born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya. I have always been interested in science and math, and this manifests itself in my chosen career track and projects. 

I'm not all about math and engineering, though-

* I am passionate about female empowerment- women supporting women. I joined an all-female living group, [WILG](http://wilg.mit.edu/), and in my first semester as a member, I was voted to be the house manager. This involved being a point person for City of Cambridge, overseeing administrative issues like city inspections. I picked up a lot of useful skills that go into maintaining a house! Being house manager also taught me how to be a leader- how to both inspire action and be tough enough to get people to do what needs to be done. I look forward to continuing to serve my house as Vice President this year.

* I write for the [MIT Admission blogs](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/author/wmuriga/). I use my writing as a tool to get people who look like me to allow themselves to dream big, to shoot for the stars and give their all to make sure they get there. I write hoping that my words will inspire self-reflection, mindful understanding and some encouragement in my audience.

* I picked up running as a hobby after high school, and I strive to squeeze a morning run into most of my days as time allows. 

* I love cooking and baking. Trying out new recipes has taught me a lot about patience and the delicate balance between risk and reward.

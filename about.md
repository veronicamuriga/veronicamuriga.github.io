I'm Veronica, a rising junior at MIT majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I was born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya. 

* Back home, I have two dogs and a cat. Yes, life never gets boring.
* I love trying out new recipes, and I stress-bake all the time.
* Coolest place I've ever been is Watamu, an idyllic beach on the Kenyan coast. 
* I write for the MIT Admission blogs.

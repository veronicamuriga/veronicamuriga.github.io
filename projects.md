## Academic Projects

### MIT SparkLab

I am currently working at MIT  SparkLab  as a lab  assistant under Professoor Luca Carlone.

The objective of my summer research is to Leverage MaskRCNN for transfer learning in Kimera (an open-source real-time SLAM software) to generate semantic labels from the RGB images simulated through Flightgoggles.

Eventually, I should be able to replace Flightgoggles with real world images and get relatively accurate metric-semantic reconstruction.

The steps I am going through are:
* Set up Kimera-VIO-ROS, FlightGoggles and all their dependencies, and run Kimera on test datasets
* Run flight goggles, get it to give me ground truth per-pixel semantic labelling (for free)
* Use a neural network (MaskRCNN) to generate semantic labels from the RGB image

I ran into some issues setting up Kimera since my computer wasn't powerful enough to handle the graphics needed for flightgoggles, so as I wait to be set up logistically I'm putting together all the errors I came across while building Kimera and running flightgoggles data on MaskRCNN. Interesting stuff.
